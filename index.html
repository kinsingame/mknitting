    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am Michael.  I am a sixth form student (2018 – 2020), and I am doing my EP on knitting.  I have learned the technique for knitting and crochet using research and some very simple objects, which can be found here and here.  Obviously, I then developed my skills more and more as I created more objects, so these two objects weren’t as good as what I could do now.  I also learned many new stitches and techniques, and I have managed to achieve from tiny keychains to a jumper.
      <br>
      I built this website from scratch using GitHub and Atom, and I learned html coding from lots of different websites, including w3schools and codecademy.
      <br>
      I was inspired into knitting, because my Granny does it, and it looked satisfying.  I actually learned from YouTube videos and research however.  I have always been into art, and I am doing art for an A-Level, but I haven’t really done anything more than painting, drawing etc.  So, I thought this would be a good opportunity to learn a completely different form of art.  I decided to code a website for it, because with a website, it is always there, so I can’t forget the skills I have developed for later in life, and I can’t lose it, like I could with a word document.  I have also always been into computers, so I thought why not make a websites and have two different sides to my Extended Project?.  I then developed two skills instead of one.  In the past, I have only done simple things with computers, but I have always been interesting in how they actually function, and what the coding looks like.
      <br>
      I am hoping to study Geology at University, in which my EP will be very useful, since they could lower the required grades to get in.  This will also be an interesting thing to bring up in my interview, as I can tell them about the skills I have developed in knitting, crochet and html coding, as you need more than just good grades to get in.  Not only is this EP useful for University, but it’s something I can carry on with later in life, but it gives me a starting point.
      <br>
      I have avoided plagiarism by linking all the different pages where I knit/crochet an object to the pattern I used to create them.  I also wrote everything on the ‘how to knit’ section by learning it first as if I wasn’t about to write his, and then I made it from my own knowledge.  This way, it’s impossible to word it any way near to another website or book.  I did the same with the issues page.
      <br>
      Thank you
